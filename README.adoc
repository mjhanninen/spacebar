*Spacebar* is a very simple game (simpler than Flappy Bird) and a tutorial
that I have written--or, to be more precise, that I am writing as an on-going
process--for my sons.  The purpose of this project is to educate them and
their friends.  Therefore pretty much everything else aside this notice and
the license information below is written in Finnish, their mother tongue.
